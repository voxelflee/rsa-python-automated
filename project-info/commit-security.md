# Commit safety

All commits should be signed with my key (certification key fingerprint: D2AC7A8F8CBF358416EF12ECF76D87C85967B1B1). If you see a commit made with my account that is not signed, please pull my key from [link will be available soon](this repository) or from an hkp keyserver and report the incident to one of my email addresses.

Thanks and have a wonderful day!
